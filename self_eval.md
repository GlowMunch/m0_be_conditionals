# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?
    So far I feel good with `<` `>` `=` and everything those can create along with `!=`. I feel like I could become better with the order in which to use them in if esle statements to help eliminate or get to the conclusion quicker, but that will come with time.
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?
    Same as above. Seemed straight forward but I'm still open to learning more and ways they can help manipulate code and get me to where I want to be faster.
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?
    Again, with this excersise I felt great with the core of if else elsif end flow and how that operates. I feel like I'm just at the beginning and about to have my mind blown.
1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?
    It was like an onion that never stopped unpealing. Largest assignment yet so if I was to draw upon past assignments I would say it took longer than I expected, but it was fine. There were some things that I had to go and figure out on my own like finding odd even with ints or multiples of 3 and 5, but that only added about 20 min maybe?
1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
    LOL everything? I think add more dead space that can be filled with research time for when I need to dive into something thats new and isn't explained in the lesson.
1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
    Whats a good resource, like a wiki for Ruby that can be found that outlines differnt parts of the languauge that can be easily searched. Does such a thing exsist?
